wiegand-linux
=============

Linux driver for reading wiegand data from GPIO. Tested  for ARM 9G20 (linux stamp)

- Ensure your arm-linux cross compiler is in your path.
  [ but we're compiling on the beagleboard itself.]

- Ensure your kernel is at the same level as this directory.
  [ but we're using a slightly different module build process; see ../example-module]
